The toppings on a pizza can vary widely, but some common ones include tomato sauce, cheese (typically mozzarella), and a variety of vegetables such as mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, and olives. Meats like pepperoni, sausage, ham, or bacon are also frequently added. Additionally, there are specialty pizzas that feature unique combinations of ingredients, such as margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil), Hawaiian (ham and pineapple), or barbecue chicken.

            <dd>
                French fries, also known as fries or chips in some regions, are a popular side dish made from potatoes. They are typically cut into long, thin strips and deep-fried until they are golden and crispy. French fries are commonly served with burgers, sandwiches, fried chicken, or as a standalone snack.

The process of making French fries involves several steps. First, the potatoes are peeled and cut into uniform strips. Then, they are usually soaked in water to remove excess starch. Afterward, the fries are dried and deep-fried in hot oil until they become crispy and golden on the outside while remaining soft on the inside. They are then typically seasoned with salt or other seasonings according to personal preference.
